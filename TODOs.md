# TODOs

- [ ] Ability to determine the response language (instead of generic "language of the conversation") 
- [ ] integrate LLM by Simon Willison to enable the use of local models 


## TODO Later

- [ ] Provide a CLI interface
- [ ] Offer installation via PyPI
- [ ] Write an error log - especially interesting for recoverable errors like LLM refusals.
- [ ] Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis? (see Simmering & Huoviala 2023)
   



## Done

- [X] Change prompts and API calls to use structured output defined by JSON schema
- [X] Provide flexible filters (e.g. ignoring conversations with max user word count 0)
